Language is ubiquitous and omnipresent. The usage of language changes entirely in different domains and settings.

Linguistics is a scientific study of language.

Different languages, dialects, and varieties of language may differ in many ways. But nouns and verbs are generally agreed upon to be universal.

When humans translate the languages, they use 
* Linguistic Knowledge
* World Knowledge
* Domain Knowledge
* Contextual Knowledge
* Cultural Knowledge
Thus, machines also need to be given these knowledges while translating.

**Unicode**
In a the quintessential Indian abugida, there is a primary vowel (à¤…) which is inherent to all the characters. The removal of a vowel, or addition of a secondary vowel each have individual unicode characters.
