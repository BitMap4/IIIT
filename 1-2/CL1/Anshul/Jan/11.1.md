**Morph Analysis**
Steps
1. The input text is tokenized (usually words)
2. The tokens are morphemically divided
3. Each of the possible morphemic divisions are described.

**Stemming**
Finding the root morpheme of each token.

**Stop Words**
They do not contribute much 'content' to the sentence. These are function words.

**POS Tagging**
Automatic assignment of descriptions of the parts of speech.

Mostly Rule Based models will be taught, but statistical models will also be explored.
