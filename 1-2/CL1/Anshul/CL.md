Jurafsky and Martin

Course Goals:
to build intermediate models that can be used later in NLP to make a full scale model

```mermaid
graph TD
a.1(NP)
a.2(Adj)
a.3(N)
a.4(Computational)
a.5(Linguistics)
a.1-->a.2
a.1-->a.3
a.2---a.4
a.3---a.5
```
The focus will be on Linguistics not Processing as in NLP

**Applications**
* Encryption/Decryption (In the war)
* Machine Translation

Computational Phonology
Computational Morphology
Computational Syntax
How to analyse sounds, words, and sentences.
