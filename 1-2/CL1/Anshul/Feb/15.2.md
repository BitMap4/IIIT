**Chunking**
This is important for Indian languages. Like morphanalysis, chunking is often skipped for European languages, they go directly from POS tagging to syntactic parsing.

Chunking is the identification and tagging of non-recursive combinations of word groups.
Example if $S = S(NP+ VP(NP(det+ N)+ PP))$ 
then chunking involves $S=NP+VP$

A verb acts like a frame. It usually encompasses/ is associated with some semantic elements which are used to make the sentence meaningful.
Some meaningful elements are often elided in the applications. How do we bring it back?
Also, speech vs. text, there is a tremendous change of information encoded.

1. All NPs must have NN, but may also have: QF (quantifier), JJ (adj), QC (cardinal quantifier), PSP (postposition), RP (particle)
2. Verb chunks must have one VM (main verb) and may have multiple VAUXs(auxiliary verb) does vaux include copula like he?
3. a



transliteration script1->script2 : ISO, IPA, WX, Loose Roman ones
translation lang1->lang2
transcription speech->text (any script)
transcreation paraphrasing lang1 -> lang2 (multiple paraphrased translations) or lang1 -> lang 1
Gloss contains all the words, content words are translated and grammatical features are given 'tags'
