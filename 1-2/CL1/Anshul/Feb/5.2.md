**POS Tagging**
Assigning a Part-of-Speech to each word in a sentence.
It aims to disambiguate by considering the context surrounding the word.
POS = *syntactic category* (not *lexical category*)  (word class, word category, syntactic category, part-of-speech)
Ex. N, V, ADV, ADJ
Ex. The word 'book' can be both a noun and a verb. 
For this course, we will only consider the word before and after the given word.

Semantically, a noun is a place, institution, person, thing, or object.

Syntactically, a noun is a category that can occur with an article, or which can take case or number, and can occur in the place of a subject, or an object, both direct and indirect.


**8 POS**
N
V
ADJ
ADV
PN (pronoun)
PRP (preposition)
CONJ
(Interjection)
(symbols($), numbers(cardinal and ordinal))


POS Tagger can be used as a pre-processor, it is used in the making of tagged corpora and MT.
Text indexing and retrieval uses POS information.
The POS is also often needed to disambiguate the pronunciation of some words. (Ex. read, live, content)


MA vs. POS

| MA | POS |
| ---- | ---- |
| lexical categories | syntactic categories |
| fewer categories | many categories |
| multiple analyses for a word  | one analysis for a word |
| case, tense, aspect, mood, gnp | context |
| all possible analyses | if there is a single category, then nothing. otherwise disambiguation.  |

POS only resolves lexical disambiguity, not syntactic disambiguity.


Ex.
Girls have broken hearts. 
Time flies like an arrow.

This cannot be resolved by POS tagging.


*This* is a nice day. (prp)
*This* day is nice. (det)
You can go *this* far. (adv)

'*This*' here can be resolved by POS tagging.


Can can can the can?
The old man the boat.
The horse raced past the barn ... fell.
We have to disambiguate going down the path. I.e. assign a POS to the first word, then to the next word, and see if the first allocation is appropriate. And so on until you reach a 'valid path'.

**Tagsets**
One of the first was the Penn-Treebank Tagset

English does not have as much of a morphological richness.
So they included these inflectional patterns within the tagset.

Indian languages cannot undergo such a thing, so we need a clear POS tagger before the morphanalysis. We have developed a BIS tagset.


**Universal Dependency Tagset/ Google POS Tagset**

Project Idea: Improve any existing NLP application using these tagsets.
