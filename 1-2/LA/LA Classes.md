### Fields: 
A set F of objects x, y, z along with 2 binary operations which we call addition and multiplication on which the following 9 conditions are satisfied:

Addition rules:
1. Addition is commutative
	$x+y=y+x \ \ \  \forall \  x,y \in F$
2. Addition is associative
	$x+(y+z) = (x+y)+z \ \ \  \forall \  x,y,z \in F$
3. $\exists$ a unique element $0$:
	   $x+0 = x \ \ \ \forall \ x \in F$
4. $\forall x \in F, \exists$ a unique element $-x$ such that $x+(-x) = 0$ 
Multiplication rules:
5. Commutative
6. Associative
7. Unique identity element, $1$
8. To each nonzero $x\in F$, there corresponds a unique element $x^{-1} \in F : x\cdot x^{-1}=1$  
Relation between addition and multiplication
9. Multiplication is distributive over addition
	$x(y+z) = xy+xz \ \ \ \forall \ x,y \in F$ 
### Homework problems
To be submitted by 11/1 class end. Prove:
1. Any subfield of $(\mathbb{C}, +, \cdot)$ must contain every rational number.
2. Set of all complex numbers of the form $x+\sqrt{2}y \ \ \ \forall \ x,y \in \mathbb{Q}$ is a subfield of $\mathbb C$.

### Matrix:
A $m \times n$ matrix is a function $A$ from the set of pairs of integers $(i,j), 1\le i\le m, 1\le j \le n$  onto the field. 
- Row equivalence is an equivalence relation. A and B are row equivalent if $e_{n}(...e_{2}(e_{1}(A))...) = B$ where $e_i$ is an elementary row operation.
