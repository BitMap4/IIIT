bro called .dmg executable lmao

OS is basically a middleware between hardware and the application/user program
does 3 things-
- easy to execute programs
- manages memory
- handles the different i/o devices

os basically abstracts hardware and resource management:
#### virtualisation (process and memory)
- gives every process the feeling that it has its own cpu
- gives the feeling that every process has infinite ram
#### concurrency
-  multiple processes can run at the same time
#### persistence
- disk is an i/o device
- os performs storage management
